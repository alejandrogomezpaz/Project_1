# Project_1 — Data Science Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a full data science workflow, including data cleaning, exploration, analysis, and visualization using Python.

**Disclaimer:** I intended to perform a machine learning regression to predict monthly revenue; however, the dataset does not contain enough data for training due to strong seasonality, making a year the smallest meaningful time unit. I will do this on another, larger timeseries data set as my next project.

## Tasks Completed
- Imported and cleaned raw dataset  
- Handled missing values and duplicates  
- Created new features for analysis  
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualized distributions, correlations, and trends  
- Generated insights and summary statistics  

## Technical Skills Used
- **Languages:** Python, SQL
- **Libraries:** pandas, PostgreSQL,numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git/GitHub  
- **Techniques:** Data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, visualization
